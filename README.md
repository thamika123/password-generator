# Password Generator

A website for generating passwords that lets users pick the length (from 6-20)
of their password as well as the types of characters (uppercase letters,
lowercase letters, numbers and symbols) that should be in it. It also lets
users copy a generated password to the clipboard by clicking on it.

The project is
based on the requirements
[here](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/2-Intermediate/Password-Generator.md).
